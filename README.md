## My Portfolio

Personal portfolio and blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build).  
It is a place to share selected work, small experiments, and notes about things I am interested in.

I chose Astro because it can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start dev server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview
```

## Linting

```bash
# Check
yarn lint

yarn lint:fix
```

ESLint is configured in `eslint.config.mjs`.
